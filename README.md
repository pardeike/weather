# weather
A simple but effective iOS app that shows the local weather.

Tired of all the weather apps that make you scroll and click through different views? This single page no bullshit app shows the 24h weather today or tomorrow with all the data on the same page. For the current location. That's it.

Build with HTML5, Cordova and paperjs. Should work on any plattform but only tested on iOS.

Any comments welcome.
